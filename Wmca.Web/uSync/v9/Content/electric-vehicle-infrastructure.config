The partnership was awarded the full allocated capital funding of £39.3 million for stage 1 of the process.  </p>\n<h3>What is it doing?</h3>\n<p>The consortium is working to ensure that the right charge point device is in the right location, to meet future EV need.<br><br>Over the last few months, the consortium has been identifying key locations for charge points based on a number of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level of on-street parking</li>\n<li>Level of car ownership</li>\n<li>Level of current and forecasted EV demand</li>\n<li>Nearby energy capacity</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Consortium members</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Derby City Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Derbyshire County Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Herefordshire Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Leicestershire County Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Lincolnshire County Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Nottingham City Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Nottinghamshire County Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Rutland County Council District Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Shropshire Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Staffordshire County Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Stoke-on-Trent City Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Telford and Wrekin Council</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Warwickshire County Council </li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">Worcestershire County Council</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Supercharging the Midlands</h3>\n<p>In September 2021, we issued a landmark report on the future of EVs in the Midlands. Our research showed that we need to drastically accelerate the roll-out of EV charge points. EV use in the Midlands is projected to increase by over 3000% by the end of 2030 and we need to cater for vehicle users by speeding up the installation of public EV charger.</p>"
