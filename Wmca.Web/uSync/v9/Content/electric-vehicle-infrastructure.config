We want the Midlands pioneer everything EV.</p>\n<h2>The Midlands EV Infrastructure Consortium</h2>\n<h3>What is the Midlands EV Infrastructure Consortium?</h3>\n<p>In 2022, Five Midlands-based Local Authorities joined forces to win just under £1 million of funding to install over 300 electric vehicle (EV) charge points across the Midlands.<br><br>The partnership between Lincolnshire County Council, Herefordshire Council, Leicestershire County Council, Rutland County Council, and Stoke-on-Trent City Council - alongside Sub-National Transport Body Midlands Connect is now called the “Midlands EV Infrastructure Consortium”.</p>\n<h3>What is it doing?</h3>\n<p>The consortium is working to ensure that the right charge point device is in the right location, to meet future EV need.<br><br>Over the last few months, the consortium has been identifying key locations for charge points based on a number of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level of on-street parking</li>\n<li>Level of car ownership</li>\n<li>Level of current and forecasted EV demand</li>\n<li>Nearby energy capacity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consortium members</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>City of Stoke-on-Trent</li>\n<li>Lincolnshire County Council</li>\n<li>Hereforeshire County Council</li>\n<li>Leicestershire County Council</li>\n<li>Rutland County Council</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Supercharging the Midlands</h2>\n<p>In September 2021, we issued a landmark report on the future of EVs in the Midlands. Our research showed that we need to drastically accelerate the roll-out of EV charge points. EV use in the Midlands is projected to increase by over 3000% by the end of 2030 and we need to cater for vehicle users by speeding up the installation of public EV charger.<br><br>Read our report ‘Supercharging the Midlands’ below:</p>"
