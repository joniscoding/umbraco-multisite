      "richText": "<p>We are supporting Warwickshire County Council to improve the A426/A4071, one of Rugby’s most strategically important routes. Motorists, pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users will all benefit from improved journey times, better reliability and new facilities.</p>\n<h2>What is the scheme?</h2>\n<p>The Avon Mill Roundabout is located north of Rugby town centre where the A426 joins the A4071 and currently suffers from high levels of congestion. The improvement scheme will increase its capacity by widening approaches and exits, as well as constructing a new roundabout at Newbold Road/Hunters Lane, replacing the existing priority junction. A short section of dual carriageway will connect the two roundabouts and include a new road bridge over the River Avon.</p>\n<p>A segregated pedestrian and cycle bridge parallel to the existing road bridge is a key feature designed to encourage more walking and cycling for local journeys. Additionally, there will be connections from the bridge to provide safe access to Rugby town centre and nearby Avon Valley School.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support growth: This road improvement scheme will help provide the additional capacity required to support new homes and businesses - Rugby Borough Council has planned over 12,000 new homes, 100 hectares of employment land and 8,000 m² of retail space to go ahead before 2031.</li>\n<li>Provide a robust network: As an alternative route to the motorway, improving journey times on this road corridor will help support the wider UK’s most important roads.</li>\n<li>Encourage active travel: A dedicated pedestrian and cycle bridge will provide safer active travel by providing a key ‘missing link’ in Rugby’s cycle network, giving cyclists better access to the town centre. Walking and cycling journeys along Leicester Road for Avon Valley School will also be made safer, with the addition of an enlarged toucan crossing on A426 Leicester Road.</li>\n<li>Improved public transport times: As a key pinch point noted by local bus operators, the upgrades will improve bus journey times and reduce delays for the four buses per hour in each direction that pass through Avon Mill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Midlands Connect submitted the Avon Mill / Hunters Lane scheme to the Department for Transport for Major Road Network Funding. Warwickshire County Council is currently developing an Outline Business Case for the scheme.</p>"
