<p>A 15-year-old girl from Dudley has been made subject of a Restorative Justice session (RJ) after she threw water over the driver of a&nbsp;bus&nbsp;in Dudley in September this year. The driver was unharmed.</p>

<p>The session involved the girl undertaking a victim awareness session, as well as writing a letter of apology to him. Restorative Justice is designed to avoid criminalising young people and keep them out of the courts.</p>

<p>Insp Rachel Crump, head of the Police Safer Travel Team said &ldquo;Our Anti-Social Behaviour Team will take every opportunity to identify young people involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour, to make public transport safe for all to travel on. Restorative Justice is shown to lead to a significant drop in re-offending, as it helps people who have committed crimes to recognise the harm they have caused whilst avoiding stigmatising them with a criminal record&rdquo;.</p>
