Midlands Connect is working with its partners Network Rail and Highways England to investigate solutions that will overcome these challenges.<br><br><strong>Delivery: </strong>Line speed improvements: 2022-2027 / Doubling of services: Post-HS2 Phase Two<br><br><strong>Journey time saving: </strong>55 min to 45 min.</p>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>A feasibility study is underway. The capital cost of delivering improvements to the corridor is estimated at £50 million.</p>"
