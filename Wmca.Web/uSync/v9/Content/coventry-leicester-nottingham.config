Because of this, just 3% of trips between Coventry and Leicester are made by rail, compared to 30% of trips between Coventry and Birmingham, which enjoys a regular, fast and direct rail connection.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Our improvements would introduce two new trains each hour, also calling at Loughborough and East Midlands Parkway, alongside plans to improve line speed along the route, making journeys faster.</p>\n<h3>What happens next?</h3>\n<p>An Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department for Transport in Summer 2021.</p>"
