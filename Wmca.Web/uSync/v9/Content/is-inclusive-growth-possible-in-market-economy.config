Poor air quality can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues. It can also have an impact on the environment, contributing to climate change and other environmental problems.<br>The West Midlands Combined Authority is committed to improving air quality in the region. We have been working closely with local authorities, businesses, and other organisations to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the issue.<br><br>One of the key areas of focus for us has been transportation. The majority of air pollution in the region comes from road traffic, so we have been working to reduce the number of cars on the road and promote more sustainable forms of transportation.<br><br>This includes investing in public transportation, cycling and walking infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging points. We have also introduced low emission zones in certain areas, which restrict the most polluting vehicles from entering.</p>"

      <Value><![CDATA[The West Midlands Combined Authority recently negotiated a devolution deal with the UK government, which grants the region greater control over issues like transportation, housing, and economic development. In this post, we'll explain what the devolution deal entails, what it means for residents of the West Midlands, and how WMCA plans to use the new powers.]]></Value>
