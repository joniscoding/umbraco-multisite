The A4123 Birchley Island scheme will aim to reduce congestion by widening approaches to the roundabout, as well as increasing capacity on the roundabout itself.<br>The scheme will also make it easier for pedestrians to cross the road and provides access for cyclists, which does not currently exist. Improved journey times and better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists will encourage more people to choose active travel and to use the bus.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce congestion: Reduce congestion and improve journey time reliability.</li>\n<li>Increase safety: Reduce the potential for accidents through improved junctions and new lane markings.</li>\n<li>Segregated pedestrian and cycle routes at each arm of the roundabout will also improve safety for active travel users.</li>\n<li>Improve public transport: Faster and more reliable journey times via public transport, encouraging residents to use the bus.</li>\n<li>Support connectivity: Improve access to M5 Junction 2, building on improvements to the motorway slip roads made by National Highways in 2013.</li>\n<li>New employment opportunities: Attract more businesses to Sandwell due to less congested roads, ultimately resulting in a higher volume of skilled labour within the region.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, the A4123 Birchley Island scheme was submitted by Midlands Connect to the Department for Transport for Major Road Network funding.</p>\n<p>In February 2021, the Department for Transport approved the Outline Business Case for the scheme and pledged to invest £24.4 million towards the construction of the scheme, subject to a Full Business Case being developed and approved. Once this is completed the scheme will be shovel ready and delivery can commence.</p>"
