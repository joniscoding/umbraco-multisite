      "richText": "<p>We’re supporting Derbyshire County Council with the development of the Chesterfield to Staveley Regeneration Route, a project that will improve the experience of all road, public transport and active travel users within Derbyshire.</p>\n<h2>What is the scheme?</h2>\n<p>The Chesterfield to Staveley Regeneration Route will be a new 5.7-kilometre-long single carriageway Connecting Chesterfield to Staveley. It will provide an alternative route to the already congested A619, which has varying speed limits (primarily 30 to 40mph).<br>The scheme will also include new pedestrian and cycling facilities, whilst also improving bridleways, to encourage active travel for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce congestion: Reducing journey times by providing an alternative to the A619, also providing a diversion route for any incidents and roadwork between M1 Junctions 29 and 30.</li>\n<li>Better public transport: Improving the frequency and reliability of public transport.</li>\n<li>Encourage active travel: Providing a safer experience for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians who may have been put off from using the route beforehand.</li>\n<li>Provide new jobs and homes: Generating 5,700 new jobs and supporting the delivery of 1,800 new homes.</li>\n<li>Essential for HS2: Linking seamlessly with HS2, providing access to the proposed HS2 Infrastructure Maintenance Depot at Staveley.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Midlands Connect submitted the Chesterfield to Staveley scheme to the Department for Transport for Large Local Major funding. In 2021, the Department for Transport committed £91 million towards the construction of the scheme, subject to the approval of the required business cases. Only when a scheme has its Full Business Case approved, will it be deemed shovel ready and delivery can begin.</p>"
