The improvement scheme consists of six junction upgrades between Ollerton and the A6097/Kirk Hill junction, East Bridgford with the aims of reducing congestion and journey stress, as well as better connecting towns within Nottinghamshire.<br>The scheme will also improve walking and cycling facilities at a number of junctions, encouraging active travel and enhancing pedestrian as well as vehicle user experience.</p>\n<h2>What will the scheme do?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce congestion: Reduce congestion and journey stress, whilst also improving journey time reliability.</li>\n<li>Improve connectivity: Support connectivity between major towns across Nottinghamshire.</li>\n<li>Support tourism: Enhance the experience of tourists, almost 5 million of whom made a trip to the area in 2019.</li>\n<li>Provide new jobs and homes: Facilitate the full delivery of major development sites along the corridor, increasing housing and employment opportunities.</li>\n<li>Improve the environment: Improve noise levels and reduce level of harmful emissions being emitted into the air.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>In summer 2018, Midlands Connect were asked by the Department for Transport (DfT) to submit MRN schemes that could be delivered in the early part of 2020 – 2025. This scheme was part of our submission and in Autumn 2018, it was announced that the scheme had been successful subject to going through the required business case stages.</p>\n<p>In June 2021, the DfT approved the Outline Business Case and granted Programme Entry for the project. The DfT would contribute £24.6 million towards its delivery, subject to approval of the next business case.<br>Nottinghamshire County Council is now developing a Full Business Case. Construction of the scheme is expected to start in Spring 2023, with the works taking approximately three years to complete.</p>"
